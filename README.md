# NeOLab-WC-models
Codes used to organize, specify and simulate Wilson-Cowan type models with different inputs


# Get Started
Add all folders to path and Run runexamples.m

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# DataStructure and backend MAP
- Defines the model object - data structure and parametrization codes
- Defines simulation backend codes adaptable to different WC models tested to allow defining them under a common framework

# ISN model library MAP
- Contains functions with previously used WC model definitions that return configured model object - summarized in parameter tables in papers
- Output objects need only be configured a bit further to specify simulation time and few more details.

# Example codes - ISN model scripts
- Some example simulations used previously for different WC model and functions used therein
